Now that you've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is still a required assignment. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is necessary if you're applying for jobs, but it's also critical on your journey as a developer.

Updated Portfolio
üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the career services milestone resources for online presence.

Your updated portfolio should:

Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as Google Voice.

Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

Project title

Link to the deployed version

Link to the GitHub repository

Screenshot of the deployed application

Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

Design
Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look "polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

Mobile-first design

Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

Updated GitHub Profile
Employers (and potential collaborators) will look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward.

Your GitHub profile must contain at least the following items:

Profile picture or avatar
A photo or an avatar other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)
Biography

Email address. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a developer email.

Link to your deployed portfolio

At least 2 pinned repositories:

Navigate to GitHub and go to your profile.

Click "Customize your pins"

Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

Follow a few of your classmates and/or other developers. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

Title of app

Live link to deployed app

List of technologies used

1-2 sentences explaining what the app is

2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app

License (usually MIT)

Contact information for you and any collaborators

Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.
